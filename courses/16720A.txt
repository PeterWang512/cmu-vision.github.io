description:: This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. The first third of the course covers low-level image processing, including filtering, warping, image descriptors, and correspondence matching. The second third of the course covers geometry and 3D motion, including image formation, camera models, optical flow, stereo, and structure from motion. The last third of the course covers pattern recognition including deep learning, convolutional neural networks. Additional topics include radiometry, color, and photometric stereo. Prerequisites include linear algebra, probabiliity, and calculus. Courses related to 16-720A include 16-385 and 16-720B.  Undergraduates should take 16-385, which serves as the undergraduate version of this course). Graduate students with little exposure to computer vision should take 16-720A, which serves as the introductory graduate version of this course. Graduate students with prior exposure to computer vision should take 16-720B, which serves as the advanced version of this course.
